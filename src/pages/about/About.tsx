					<p>
					Back in 2012, I got my hands on my first computer which started my journey of playing around with technology.
					From building and upgrading my computer to modding games to coding and web development.
					</p>
					<p>
					Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working on software in a huge corporation during an
					internship and I'm an aspiring graduate software engineer.
					</p>
					<p>
					Outisde of sitting at the computer I have a passion for health and nutrition, I lift weights and body build
					at the gym. I also like to hike and skate on inline skates.
